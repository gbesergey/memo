[repeated patternmatch]
	case - mouse move
		not the case - every mouse move has its small action
[maybe replace InputProcessors with tuples of startingstate, patternmatcher and action]
//cancels related trouble
	if starting state not very precise (for example ANY) and no cancel - then can be generated a lot of PatternMatcher which will no complete until they match
		use firstMatch in PatternMatcher			
//way to unify Messages from different sources (call to feed)
	through identity check in feed
